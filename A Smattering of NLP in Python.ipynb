    "## Introduction\n",
    "Back in the dark ages of data science, each group or individual working in Natural Language Processing (NLP) generally maintained an assortment of homebrew utility programs designed to handle many of the common tasks involved with NLP. Despite everyone's best intentions, most of this code was lousy, brittle, and poorly documented -- not a good foundation upon which to build your masterpiece. Fortunately, over the past decade, mainstream open source software libraries like the [Natural Language Toolkit for Python (NLTK)](http://www.nltk.org/) have emerged to offer a collection of high-quality reusable NLP functionality. These libraries allow researchers and developers to spend more time focusing on the application logic of the task at hand, and less on debugging an abandoned method for sentence segmentation or reimplementing noun phrase chunking.\n",
    "\n",
    "This presentation will cover a handful of the NLP building blocks provided by NLTK (and a few additional libraries), including extracting text from HTML, stemming & lemmatization, frequency analysis, and named entity recognition. Several of these components will then be assembled to build a very basic document summarization program.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Initial Setup\n",
    "Obviously, you'll need Python installed on your system to run the code examples used in this presentation. We enthusiatically recommend using [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/), a Python distribution provided by [Continuum Analytics](http://www.continuum.io/). Anaconda is free to use, it includes nearly [200 of the most commonly used Python packages for data analysis](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs.html) (including NLTK), and it works on Mac, Linux, and yes, even Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Anaconda logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlieg/A-Smattering-of-NLP-in-Python/master/images/anaconda_logo_web.png)](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll make use of the following Python packages in the example code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/install.html) (comes with Anaconda)\n",
    "- [readability-lxml](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability)\n",
    "- [BeautifulSoup4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) (comes with Anaconda)\n",
    "- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) (comes with Anaconda)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the **readability** package is not distributed with Anaconda, so you'll need to download & install it separately using something like <code>easy_install readability-lxml</code> or <code>pip install readability-lxml</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't use Anaconda, you'll also need to download & install the other packages separately using similar methods. Refer to the homepage of each package for instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll want to run <code>nltk.download()</code> one time to get all of the NLTK packages, corpora, etc. (see below). Select the \"all\" option. Depending on your network speed, this could take a while, but you'll only need to do it once.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Java libraries (optional)\n",
    "One of the examples will use NLTK's interface to the [Stanford Named Entity Recognizer](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml#Download), which is distributed as a Java library. In particular, you'll want the following files handy in order to run this particular example:\n",

    "## Frequency Analysis\n",
    "Here's a little secret: much of NLP (and data science, for that matter) boils down to counting things. If you've got a bunch of data that needs *analyzin'* but you don't know where to start, counting things is usually a good place to begin. Sure, you'll need to figure out exactly what you want to count, how to count it, and what to do with the counts, but if you're lost and don't know what to do, **just start counting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps we'd like to begin (as is often the case in NLP) by examining the words that appear in our document. To do that, we'll first need to tokenize the text string into discrete words. Since we're working with English, this isn't so bad, but if we were working with a non-whitespace-delimited language like Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, it would be much more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet below, we're using two of NLTK's tokenize methods to first chop up the article text into sentences, and then each sentence into individual words. (Technically, we didn't need to use <code>sent_tokenize()</code>, but if we only used <code>word_tokenize()</code> alone, we'd see a bunch of extraneous sentence-final punctuation in our output.) By printing each token alphabetically, along with a count of the number of times it appeared in the text, we can see the results of the tokenization. Notice that the output contains some punctuation & numbers, hasn't been loweredcased, and counts *BuzzFeed* and *BuzzFeed's* separately. We'll tackle some of those issues next."

Here, we'll use the Snowball stemmer for English, which comes with NLTK.\n",

We also (probably) won't show the stemmed words to users -- we'll normally just use them for internal analysis or indexing purposes."

While the process of stemming typically involves rule-based methods of stripping affixes (making them small & fast), **lemmatization** involves dictionary-based methods to derive the canonical forms (i.e., *lemmas*) of words. For example, *run*, *runs*, *ran*, and *running* all correspond to the lemma *run*.

    "## Named Entity Recognition\n",
    "Another task we might want to do to help identify what's \"important\" in a text document is [named entity recogniton (NER)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition). Also called *entity extraction*, this process involves automatically extracting the names of persons, places, organizations, and potentially other entity types out of unstructured text. Building an NER classifier requires *lots* of annotated training data and some [fancy machine learning algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field), but fortunately, NLTK comes with a pre-built/pre-trained NER classifier ready to extract entities right out of the box. This classifier has been trained to recognize PERSON, ORGANIZATION, and GPE (geo-political entity) entity types.\n",
    "\n",
    "(At this point, I should include a disclaimer stating [No True Computational Linguist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman) would ever use a pre-built NER classifier in the \"real world\" without first re-training it on annotated data representing their particular task. So please don't send me any hate mail -- I've done my part to stop the madness.)\n",

    "- run this through the NLTK-provided NER classifier using <code>nltk.ne_chunk()</code>\n",
    "- parse these intermediate results and return any extracted entities\n",

    "We then apply this method to a sample sentence and parse the clunky output format provided by <code>nltk.ne_chunk()</code> (it comes as a [nltk.tree.Tree](http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/tree.html)) to display the entities we've extracted. Don't let these nice results fool you -- NER output isn't always this satisfying. Try some other sample text and see what you get."

    "#### Generating the Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all we'll need to produce a summary for any document in the corpus. In the example code below, we start by randomly selecting an article from the Reuters Corpus. We iterate through the article, calculating a score for each sentence by summing the TF-IDF values for each word appearing in the sentence. We normalize the sentence scores by dividing by the number of tokens in the sentence (to avoid bias in favor of longer sentences). Then we sort the sentences by their scores, and return the highest-scoring sentences as our summary. The number of sentences returned corresponds to roughly 20% of the overall length of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since some of the articles in the Reuters Corpus are rather small (i.e., a single sentence in length) or contain just raw financial data, some of the summaries won't make sense. If you run this code a few times, however, you'll eventually see a randomly-selected article that provides a decent demonstration of this simplistic method of identifying the \"most important\" sentence from a document."

Perhaps we could boost the importance of words found in the title or any entities we're able to extract from the text. After initially selecting the highest-scoring sentence, we might discount the TF-IDF scores for duplicate words in the remaining sentences in an attempt to reduce repetitiveness. We could also look at cleaning up the sentences used to form the summary by fixing any pronouns missing an antecedent, or even pulling out partial phrases instead of complete sentences.
